## Hashlist and Metadata Tool

### Description
This tool is being built to do a number of things that I will soon need to do on a regular basis.
It is a work in progress and will be updated as I have time to work on it.

#### The tool is going to be capable of the following:

* Pull the metadata token account hashlist from first creator.
* Decode the account data for each address in the hashlist.
* Create a hashlist from the token address (mint address).
* Pull the off-chain metadata for each token address in the hashlist and save it locally as a JSON (filename = "tokenName.json").
* Pull the images from the off-chain metadata and save them locally (the default filename will be "mintAddress.png").
* Edit the off-chain metadata and automatically re-upload it to your shdw-drive or a location of your choice.
